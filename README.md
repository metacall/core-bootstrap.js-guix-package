# MetaCall Core Bootstrap.js Guix Package

This repository is used to package in a single `.tgz` all the dependencies from Node Loader related to Bootstrap.js. This is needed due to how restrictive Guix build system is, and also because packaging NPM packages in Guix is a hell, so we use this as workaround.
